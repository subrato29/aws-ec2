Difference between Amazon S3 and EC2
------------------------------
```
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) are two major storage services 
for AWS. 
- S3 is more lightweight and provides the capability to store data. 
- EC2, on the other hand, 
  is a web service that provides secure, resizable computing capacity in the cloud
